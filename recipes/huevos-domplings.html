    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken and dumplings is a soup-like dish that consists of chicken, a thick broth, and dumplings made out of
        biscuit dough. The iconic comfort food is filling, made with cheap ingredients, and deliciously cozy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Here's what you'll need to make incredibly easy slow cooker chicken and dumplings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Chicken</strong>
            Opt for boneless, skinless chicken breast halves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Butter</strong>
            Butter adds creaminess and richness to this comforting meal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Canned Soup</strong>
            Two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup make this Crock-Pot chicken and dumplings recipe quick and easy
            to throw together.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Onion</strong>
            Kick the flavor up a notch with a diced onion. As the chicken and dumplings cook, the flavor will deepen.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Refrigerated Biscuit Dough</strong>
            Instead of making homemade dumplings, try using refrigerated biscuit dough for a convenient shortcut.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Place chicken, condensed soup, onion, and butter in a slow cooker. Add enough water to cover; stir well.
                Cover and cook on High for 5 to 6 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>About 30 minutes before serving, tear biscuit dough into pieces. Place dough in the slow cooker. Cook
                until dough is no longer raw in the center.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
        </li>
